# XF Roof Module

Deutsche Anleitung: [LIESMICH.md](https://github.com/viper-666/xf_roof_module/blob/master/LIESMICH.md)

An modul that automatic opened and closed the roof of an Chrysler Crossfire convertible up to 50 kph or 31 mph (recommended). You don't need to hold the open or close button the whole time the roof works. You can set the max speed (in kph) until the roof works in the Arduino sketch, you have only to change the value of the variable "int GESCHWINDIGKEIT = 50".
But don't go to high, you can damage your roof.

I have tested this modul now for a few month without any problem, but you build it to your own risks. I can't give you any warrant that it don't damage anything of your car.


## Getting Started

First you have to build the hardware. Sorry, I'm don't have the skills to build a PCB you can order. Maybee you can do that and give me the file, so that the other can use it.
So you have to build it on an perfboard like I build the prototyp.

## Built With

* [ARDUINO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) - I used the Version 1.6.8
* [EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) - The Software is free for peronal use but you have to make an Autodesk Account.
